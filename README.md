# Real Time Bus Tracker
##About:
The goal of this project was to create a real time bus tracker using the MTA API. The map updates every 15 seconds by pulling real time data from the API. 
##Steps for Use:
In order to use this project, you can fork and clone this repository to make any updates.
##Future Improvements:
In the future, I'd like to add permanent markers on the map for the bus stops on the route. I'd also like to find a public API for a different city to recreate this project.
